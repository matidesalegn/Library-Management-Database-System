# Library-Management-Database-System
The library management system is a project which aims in developing a computerized system to maintain all the daily work of the library. This project has many features which are generally not available in normal library management systems like a search book using book title, author name, or ISBN (International Standard Book Number), loan book, reserve book, etc. Online Library Management System is a system that maintains the information about the books present in the library, their authors, the members of the library to whom books are issued, library staff, and all.  This is very difficult to organize manually. Maintenance of all this information manually is a very complex task. Owing to the advancement of technology, the organization of an Online Library becomes much simple. The Online Library Management has been designed to computerize and automate the operations performed over the information about the members, book issues, returns, and all other operations. This computerization of the library helps in many instances of its maintenances. It reduces the workload of management as most of the manual work done is reduced. Overall, this project of ours is being developed to help the students as well as staff of the library to maintain the library in the best way possible and also reduce the human efforts.
